# Server-Side Events (SSE) Car Tracking Example

This project demonstrates the implementation of Server-Side Events (SSE) for real-time updates within a monorepo using NX. The example focuses on car tracking.

## Features

- **Car Tracking:** Simulates real-time tracking of a car's location using SSE.
- **Chakra UI Integration:** Utilizes Chakra UI for a clean and aesthetically pleasing user interface.
- **Google Maps Integration:** Displays the car's location on a Google Map component.

## Project Structure

- `apps/sse-example`: React application source code.
  - `components`: React components used in the application.
  - `App.js`: Main application component.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.
- `apps/backend`: Server-side code for handling SSE events.
- `libs`: Shared libraries, configurations, and utilities.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sse-example.git
   cd sse-example
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Environment Variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file at the project root.
   - Add your Google Maps API key:

     ```plaintext
     REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
     ```

4. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   npm run web
   ```

   This starts the development server for the React application. You can access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. **Run the Backend:**

   ```bash
   npm run backend
   ```

   This starts the server-side code for handling SSE events.

## Usage

- Open the application in your web browser.
- Click the "Place Order" button to simulate a car tracking event.
- The car's location will be updated in real-time on the Google Map.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Chakra UI
- Google Maps API
- Server-Side Events (SSE)
- NX (Monorepo)

## Scripts

- `npm run web`: Start the React application.
- `npm run backend`: Start the server-side code for SSE events.

## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve sse-example`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!


## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
